On its territory there are clothing, wholesale, retail and food markets; warehouse and vehicle fleet complexes operate, entrepreneurs from Kyrgyzstan and neighboring countries buy and bring goods at affordable prices.\n\nThe structure includes unique wholesale platforms (e.g., 'Dordoi-Auto Parts'), where goods come directly from manufacturers in China, Turkey, Russia, Korea and Europe, allowing to reduce prices for end customers.\n\nThe complex is accompanied by developed infrastructure: rental of trading spaces and warehouses, bank service points, electronic payments, 24/7 security and logistics park. All this makes Dordoi a convenient center for trade and export."
